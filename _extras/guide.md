## Q&A Sessions

See [here](https://github.com/SABS-R3/software-engineering-day1/blob/gh-pages/_extras/guide-common-qa.md) for a set of suggested common points and questions to raise during a Q&A session. In addition to these, see below for points specific to particular Q&A sessions.

### Day 4: Morning Q&A Session

- Day 3 afternoon group exercise feedback
    - Each group has two minutes for its reporter to highlight the two biggest positive things they found
    - Ask each group to focus on a very brief description of what they found and how it benefits users and developers of the software 
    - After all groups finished, highlight common themes uncovered by the groups, and mention the idea behind the two group exercises on Day 3 is to give the learners a contrasting view of what repos can end up like - between a repo that had some major obstacles to further development and reuse, and another that really made an effort, and the characteristics of each
    - Mention that, particularly in academia, you probably won't be able to employ all the good practices and techniques you would like, but what you can do is prioritise and adopt those that will give you the most benefit. You can always add to these practices and amend existing ones over time (which is a good idea anyway!)
